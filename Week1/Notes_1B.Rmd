Vectors in R
===

<center>![](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/vectors.png){width=300px}</center>

Atomic vectors are <i>homogeneous</i>, i.e., all elements of the vectors are of the same type.
The types of atomic vectors (or just vectors) are:

- <tt>double</tt>: double-precision floating-point numbers (8 bytes per element);

- <tt>integer</tt>: integer numbers (4 bytes per element);

- <tt>logical</tt>: <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt>;

- <tt>character</tt>: individual strings (at 1 byte per individual character within each string);

- and <tt>complex</tt> and <tt>raw</tt> (not covered here).

Note: the <tt>integer</tt> and <tt>double</tt> types are collectively (and at times confusingly)
dubbed <tt>numeric</tt>. (Confusingly because one can cast to a numeric type, which is equivalent to
casting to double.)

Initializing Vectors
===

Let's show the various ways in which one can initialize a vector 
(in this case, of integers) of length five:

<table>
<tr><td><tt>x = c(0,0,0,0,0)<tt></td><td>c = "collection" or "container"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = rep(0,5)<tt></td><td>rep = "repeat"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = vector("integer",5)</tt></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = integer(5)</tt></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = seq(1,5,by=1)</tt></td><td>seq = "sequence"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = 1:5</tt></td><td>steps by 1</td></tr>
</table>

Note that one can use all six of these functions to initialize <tt>numeric</tt> vectors, and the first four to initialize those of mode <tt>logical</tt> or <tt>character</tt>, as with, e.g.,
```{r}
vector("logical",5)
character(5)
```

Note: there is no such thing as a "scalar" in <tt>R</tt>, i.e., <tt>x = 1</tt> defines a 
double-precision vector of length 1.

Handy Vector Functions
===

To determine the type of a vector:
```{r}
x = c(1,0,3,2)
typeof(x)
```

To determine the number of elements in a vector:
```{r}
length(x)
```

To display the $n^{th}$ element of a vector, where $n \in [1,length(x)]$:
```{r}
x[1]
```

To explicitly cast from one type to another:
```{r}
as.character(x)
as.logical(x)
```

Handy Vector Functions
===

To sort a vector in ascending order, and to retrieve the sorted vector indices:
```{r}
x
sort(x)
order(x)
```

To reverse a vector:
```{r}
rev(x)
```

Logical Subsetting
===

<center>![](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/relational.png){width=400px}</center>

If you apply a relational operator to a vector, the output will be a logical vector:
```{r}
set.seed(101)
x = rnorm(10)
x>0
```

<b>&iexcl;MUY IMPORTANTE&excl;</b> If you apply a logical vector of length $n$ to a vector of
length $n$, then <i>only the elements of the second vector associated with the value TRUE will
be displayed!</i> For instance:
```{r}
x
x[x>0]
```

Logical Subsetting
===

The output from relational operators can be combined using the logical and operator (&amp;) or the
logical or operator (|):
```{r}
y = x>0 & x<0.5
x[y]
y = x<0 | x>0.5
x[y]
```

To invert the logical vector, use the ! operator:
```{r}
x[!y]
```

Logical Subsetting
===

To determine how many values in your vector satisfy a condition, combine one or more relational
operators with the <tt>sum()</tt> function:
```{r}
sum(x>-0.5&x<0)
```

To determine which elements of the original vector satisfy a condition, combine one or more
relational operators with the <tt>which()</tt> function:
```{r}
which(x>-0.5&x<0)
```

Another means by which to subset a vector is to apply the output of the <tt>which()</tt> function. 
Note how adding a minus sign changes the output!
```{r}
w = which(x<0)
x[w]
x[-w]
```

NA vs. NaN vs. Inf
===

- <tt>NA</tt> means "Not Available" and is the preferred way in <tt>R</tt> to denote missing data.

- <tt>NaN</tt> means "Not a Number" and denotes, e.g, 0/0.

- <tt>Inf</tt> means "Infinite" and denotes, e.g., 1/0.

To determine whether vector elements are, e.g., <tt>NA</tt>, we can use the <tt>is.na()</tt>,
<tt>is.nan()</tt>, and/or <tt>is.infinite()</tt> functions. Each returns a logical vector.
```{r}
x = c(1,NA,3)
is.na(x)
x[!is.na(x)]
```
