Lists
===

<center>![](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/vectors.png){width=300px}</center>

As can be seen above, a list is <i>not</i> an atomic entity; it may be thought
of as a (perhaps heterogeneous) collection of atomic vectors:
```{r}
x = list(1:5,c("a","b"))
x
```

A list in <tt>R</tt> is like a dictionary in <tt>Python</tt>.

Accessing List Elements
===

For reasons that will become apparent soon, it is perhaps best to think of a list as a "table," with
each separate vector in the list being a "column" within that table. (Yes, the number of rows can vary
from column to column, but work with me here.) To access a "column," you use "double-bracket" notation:
```{r}
x[[2]]
```

To access a particular "row" in a given column, you can tack on its number:
```{r}
x[[1]][3]
```

Naming List "Columns"
===

When you initialize a list, you can name each of the vectors and then use the names to access list
elements. Note the use of the dollar sign in the third line below; it is a useful shorthand.
```{r}
x = list(u=1:5,v=c("a","b"))
x[["u"]][3]
x$u[3]
```

Data Frames
===

A data frame is a list whose entries all have the same number of elements.
```{r}
x = data.frame(u=1:2,v=c("a","b"),w=c(TRUE,FALSE))
x
```
Note that when we output a data frame, row numbers are added.

Are we sure this is a list? Yes...if we check the variable type:
```{r}
typeof(x)
class(x)
```

Matrices
===

A matrix may be thought of as a data frame whose columns are all vectors of the same type. However, operations applied to a matrix are fundamentally different from those applied to a list.
```{r}
x = matrix(1:6,nrow=2)
x      # the matrix filled column-by-column (column-major order)
x[[1]] # doesn't work like you'd think it should
x[2,1] # works: row first, then column
```
