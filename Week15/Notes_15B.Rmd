Foreign Keys
===

A foreign key is a (collection of) column(s) in one table that <i>uniquely</i> specifies a row in another table. We specify foreign keys using the `references` keyword when we define a column or table. Though it is not required to do so, it is most common for a foreign key to reference another table's primary key.

Assume you have the following table:
```
create table countries ( 
  country_code char(2) primary key, 
  country_name text unique 
);
```
populated with
```
insert into countries values 
  ('us','United States'), ('mx','Mexico');
```

We can then define another table, `cities`, that contains a foreign key referencing `country_code`:
```
create table cities (
  name text not null,
  postal_code varchar(9) check (postal_code <> '') primary key,
  country_code char(2) check (country_code <> ''),
  foreign key (country_code) references countries 
);
insert into cities values 
  ('Pittsburgh','15213','us');
insert into cities values 
  ('Toronto','M4C185','ca');
```
The first insert will work, because the table countries contains the code `us`, while the second insert will fail (at least until information on Canada is inserted into `countries`).

Joining Two Tables
===

The purpose of a `join` is to allow a single `select` command to access information in two tables. There are many flavors of joins: inner joins, left joins, full outer joins, set differences, etc.

This just shows some of the possibilities. A query for set differences, for instance, might return all rows of Table A that are *not* in Table B.

Joining Two Tables
===

We'll begin by demonstrating an *inner* join, which produces rows for which the columns in **both** tables match. (This is akin to performing a `select` on the *intersection* of two tables.)
```
create table A (id serial primary key, name text);
insert into A (name) values ('Freeman'),('Greenhouse');
create table B (id serial primary key, name text);
insert into B (name) values ('Tibshirani'),('Nugent'),('Freeman');
select * from A join B on A.name = B.name;
 id |  name   | id |  name   
----+---------+----+---------
  1 | Freeman |  3 | Freeman
(1 row)
```

Instead of displaying all columns, you can as a subset, and rename them with `as`:
```
select A.name as name_a, B.name as name_b from A join B on A.name = B.name;
 name_a  | name_b  
---------+---------
 Freeman | Freeman
(1 row)
```

Joining Two Tables
===

A *full outer join* produces rows for all columns in **both** tables. This is akin to performing a `select` on the *union* of the two tables.

```
select A.name as name_a,B.name as name_b from A full outer join B on A.name = B.name;
   name_a   |   name_b   
------------+------------
 Freeman    | Freeman
 Greenhouse | 
            | Nugent
            | Tibshirani
(4 rows)
```

A *left outer join* produces all rows for the first table (here: A), and any matching rows for the second table (here: B).

```
select * from A left outer join B on A.name = B.name;
 id |    name    | id |  name   
----+------------+----+---------
  1 | Freeman    |  3 | Freeman
  2 | Greenhouse |    | 
(2 rows)
```

(Yes, there indeed is a `right outer join` too.)

Joining Two Tables
===

To select the set difference, e.g., all rows of A that are <b>not</b> in B, use a left or right outer join along with judicious `where` clause:

```
select * from A left outer join B on A.name = B.name where B.id is null;
 id |    name    | id | name 
----+------------+----+------
  2 | Greenhouse |    | 
(1 row)
```

To select the symmetric difference, i.e., all rows of A not in B and vice-versa, use a full outer join along with a longer but still judicious `where` clause:

```
select * from A full outer join B on A.name = B.name where B.id is null or A.id is null;
 id |    name    | id |    name    
----+------------+----+------------
  2 | Greenhouse |    | 
    |            |  2 | Nugent
    |            |  1 | Tibshirani
(3 rows)
```
